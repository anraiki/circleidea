# Getting Started

Client and Server folder both need to run `npm install`

Build the dockerfile with `docker build .` and that is with the perod.

Then you can compose it up: `docker-compose up -d `

The -d flag is to run docker in the background. When you want to take it down use `docker-compose down`
