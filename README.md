# What is Circle Idea

It is a project managing, note taking, idea making application.

# Welcome

We are a tiny community creating a project managing app in Typescript. The idea is to make something better than Trello, and make all sorts of neat feature that will help us be better in productivity.

# Getting Started

Our server is [a headless api](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_content_management_system) that we use our client, made in [React.JS](https://reactjs.org/), to inteface with. 

If you want to get started, you will need [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed as well as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

# Requirements

Run `npm install` on the root directory

Build the dockerfile with `docker build .` and that is with the perod.

Then you can compose it up: `docker-compose up -d `

The -d flag is to run docker in the background. When you want to take it down use `docker-compose down`
